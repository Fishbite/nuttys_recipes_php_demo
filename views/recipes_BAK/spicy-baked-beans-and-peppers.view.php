          <strong>Spicy Baked Beans & Peppers!</strong> This is something my
          mother used to put together for barbecues & parties. I've altered it
          slightly as were not keen on barbecue style sauces. If you are, I have
          given you that option as well, which basically involves adding tomato
          kepchup & brown sauce to create a barbecue sauce. This can be eaten
          hot or cold, so it's a perfect addition to a picnic style lunch or
          buffet. I last served this for dinner with my home made "Cheese &
          Onion Quiche" & "Spicy Potato Wedges" and both those recipes can be
          found over on the recipe page. But, 15 minutes & this side dish should
          be done and ready to serve with whatever you please :-)
