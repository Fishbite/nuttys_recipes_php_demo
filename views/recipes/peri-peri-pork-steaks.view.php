          <strong>Peri Peri Pork Steaks</strong> are so easy to make, try to
          allow 24hrs for the marinade to tenderise the meat, it'll cook on my
          health grill in about 4 minutes, or, about 8 minutes under a standard
          grill. This recipe is always a winner as it's bouncing with flavour
          and very few ingredients are required, and, if you have marinated the
          pork steaks overnight, all you need to do is knock up some healthy
          summer salad to accompany the steaks. <strong>Please note:</strong> I
          have not added salt as the spice mix I am using contains salt already,
          so you will need to check your spice mix ingredients

                First things first! Grill / blacken your red pepper as we are
                going to use this in the marinade. I'm using a long pointy red
                pepper, but a normal bell pepper will do just as well. When done
                and cooled, gather the rest of the ingredients for the marinade
                and pop everything (except the pork & mayonaise!) into a food
                processor (or mash everything up in a pestal and mortar) and
                process until it forms a paste.
              </p>
              <p>Marinate overnight if you can, it helps tenderise the meat.</p>
              <p>
                I've included a little 10 second recipe for a sauce &mdash;
                Perinaise &mdash; to go on the side, it really goes excellently
                with the <strong>Peri Peri Pork Steaks</strong>.

                  1/2 or 1/4 your red pepper, de-seed it and pop it onto a grill
