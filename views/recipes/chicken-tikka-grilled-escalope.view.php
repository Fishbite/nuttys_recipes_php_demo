          I'm so excited to bring you my
          <strong>Chicken Tikka Grilled Escalopes</strong>
          recipe that I can hardly contain myself! Now we all know this dish
          from the Indian takeaways as a truly delicious starter: little chunks
          of marinaded chicken served with raita & side salad. I'm switching it
          up here, as I want to use my Health Grill and create a complete dinner
          served with naan bread, raita & salad. Now you could of course do this
          in an air fryer, please refer to instructions of your Air fryer! But,
          be sure to cut your chicken breast escalope to fit on the grill plate!

                You will be pleasantly surprised as to how easy it is to make
                <strong>Chicken Tikka Grilled Escalopes</strong>. It's just a
                matter of making the marinade, which is really easy to do too!
              </p>
              <p>
                Chicken escalopes are just flattened pieces of chicken, in this
                case, chicken breasts. We need to flatten them out so that they
                are an even thickness all over, then they will cook evenly on
                the grill. My only word of caution is, make sure the breast is
                well wrapped before you bash it, because you seriously don't
                want to spray raw chicken all over your kitchen!

                If using an in-oven grill, place the meat as close to the grill
                as you can, it will take twice as long &mdash; 10 to 14 minutes,
                & needs turning half way through

                No matter how you cook it, you need to check it is properly
                cooked all the way through. Put a meat thermometor into the
                center of one breast, as an absolute minimum 75c is perfect, as
                it will continue to cook a little while resting*. Resting is
                quite important, as it will allow the meat to relax and let the
                juices soak back into the meat.
