        Christmas is nearly upon us! So, what better than making your own
        <strong>Sausage Roll & Caramalised Onion</strong>
        <strong>log</strong>. Yes! I do mean a <strong>LOG</strong>, one big,
        <em>humongous</em>, sausage roll! Firstly, check the size of your
        biggest baking tray, one that can accomodate the monster....I'm making
        this easy so you have plenty of time to make a home made Tomato
        Chutney too! :-P Ready rolled pastry, two packs of sausages and
        caramalised onions, simple!

              The first thing you need to do is get those onions on to
              caramalise. While those are cooking, you can get everything else
              ready.

              So, gather the ingredients for the caramalised onions and let's

              <strong>Check for doneness</strong>: Use a meat thermometer, if

              temperature should be 75&deg;C to 80&deg;C. If you don't have a
              meat thermometer, insert a sharp knife into the center of the
              sausage roll for a few seconds, pull it out and touch the back
              of your hand, it should be too hot to keep it there!

              <strong>Sausage Roll & Caramalised Onion</strong> Now this is
              easy, a fork ;-0 and some of my home made tomato chutney. Guess
              what? I made that on the same day too & never even broke out
              into Nutty's stess mode! Admittedly, we had some shoe string
              fries, as waiting for the sausage roll to cool was torture!
