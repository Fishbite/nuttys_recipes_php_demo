          Now this <strong>Pear, Coconut & Blackberry Cake</strong> works
          perfectly as a pudding or a cake, the coconut adds flavour and texture
          to the sponge and also keeps it really moist. It's really so easy to
          make and deliciously tasty. Just add ice cream or custard for a crowd
          pleasing pudding, or, serve with a cup of afternoon tea, it's just
          perfect! I'm using up the last of the crop of blackberries from last
          years' harvest, collected from the cricket club just over the road
          from my kitchen. I'll be able to replenish my stock soon though
          &mdash; when we go foraging a little later in the year, I always look
          forward to that!

                <strong>*</strong> I use shop brought cake tin liners as they
                save time & fuss, but, you can use baking paper if you prefer.

                <strong>**</strong> It's slightly tricky to test for doneness as
                you have juice from the berries running through the cake, but,
                try sticking a wooden skewer in a couple of places to see if you
                get cake mix or just juice. The skewer should come out dry
                without cake mix stuck to it. If it comes out covered in berry
                juice, try another place! If it comes out covered in sticky cake
                mix, pop it back in the oven for 5 minutes more, then check
                again.

                Serve <strong>Pear, Coconut & Blackberry Cake</strong> hot or

                moist that it doesn't need them, but, some people insist on that
                extra indulgence!
