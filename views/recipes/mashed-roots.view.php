          Nutty's Kitchen's <strong>Mashed Roots</strong> side dish is a
          lighter, healthier alternative to mashed potatoes. &mdash; As it's
          using root vegetables. All the weights are solely for guidance and are
          roughly what I used. Feel free to adjust, but be sure to have equal
          swede and carrots with slightly more potatoes as we're doing this as
          an accompaniment for a dinner with no additional potatoes. A complete
          creamy mash for a winters night. We have thunder and lighting here
          today, so this will make a perfect accompaniment to my rich Roast Pork
          Stroganoff.

                Chop your vegetables into chunks, potatoes are the softest so
                leave them a little larger. Put them into a large pan so the
                veg' is just one layer, cover with cold water and add salt
              </p>

                <li>Put them on a high heat until they come to the boil</li>
                <li>Lower the heat & simmer for 20 minutes</li>
                <li>Check each type of root is soft with a fork</li>

                *The age of the root vegetables determines how quickly they cook
                &mdash; the older they are, the longer they take to cook. So be
                sure to check thoroughly that they are ready to mash. If, heaven
                forbid you have stubborn swede don't panic simply remove the
                others with a drainer and mash them. Whilst continuing to cook
                the swede until tender enough &mdash; then mash that and combine
                with the other mashed veg'. I'm going to use a potato ricer then
                a whisk. This can be done with a potato masher, but I find it's
                easier with a ricer.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Put the roots into a colander to drain</li>
                <li>Tip into a bowl when dry</li>
                <li>Mash down to a smooth consistency**</li>

                **You can leave these in the bowl then reheat with your butter &
                milk when ready to serve. Just cover with cling film once
                cooled. But <em><strong>do not</strong></em> place into the
                fridge, as your mash will change consistancy. Don't ask me why,
                it's all scientific stuff ho! hum!
