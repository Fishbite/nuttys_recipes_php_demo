          <strong>Cauliflower Curry</strong>, now firstly & maybe obviously you
          need to like cauliflower to try this dish as it really is what it says
          in the title! Delicate, not too spicy, in a creamy coconut sauce.
          There is one ingredient you may not as yet have in your growing Indian
          spices &mdash; Gram flour, but, here it is essential, so go buy some
          before even attempting this dish as plain flour will not work ;-0 Gram
          flour has a flavour all of its own and can not be substituted, it also
          thickens the sauce.
