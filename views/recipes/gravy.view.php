          This quick and easy homemade gravy recipe allows you to create rich,
          flavorful gravy without relying on instant granules, which often
          contain unnecessary additives.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this recipe uses beef stock cubes as an example, you can easily
          substitute them with chicken, pork, or lamb to complement your dish.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using stock cubes is a simple and effective way to enhance your
          gravy's depth of flavor without additional processed ingredients. This
          recipe serves two, but you can easily adjust the quantities to
          accommodate more.

                Whenever you need to whip up some <strong>gravy</strong>, this
                recipe is a fantastic starting point. Plus, I have a few expert
                tips to elevate the flavor and make your
                <strong>gravy</strong> even more delicious!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are roasting a joint of meat or frying steaks, chops or
                even diced meat of any kind, put your meat to one side to rest
                and keep warm while you make the <strong>Gravy</strong>. This
                will allow the meat to relax and become more tender and juicy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take your hot meat tin / pan and deglaze it with some water, put
                it back on the heat (or in the oven) until it's hot and then
                give the bottom of the pan / tin a good scrape with a wooden
                spoon to get all those wonderful brown bits off the bottom.
                Substitute some or all of the water stated in the ingredients
                with these juices.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Nine times out of ten, this is how I'll
                make my <strong>Gravy</strong>. However, I will occasionally
                deglaze the pan with a glass of red or white wine (depending on
                the type of meat) to make an even more luxurious
                <strong>Gravy</strong>!
              </p>

              <p>
                The <strong>Gravy</strong> comes together rather quickly, so
                have everything to hand and ready to use.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  add your butter to a medium hot saucepan & allow it to melt
                </li>
                <li>add your flour and stir to combine & create a roux</li>
                <li>mix your Bisto&trade; with the 300ml of water* & whisk</li>
                <li>crumble in both your stock cubes</li>
                <li>add the water & Bisto&trade; mix to your pan</li>
                <li>stir constantly until it thickens & starts to simmer</li>
                <li>check the seasoning add salt if required</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                <strong>*</strong>Substitute some or all of the water with your
                meat juices if you have them.
              </p>
